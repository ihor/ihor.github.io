      <description>Sharing code between the web and native was one of the most interesting React Native questions since its appearance. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t the original goal of the React Native but when all our code base is written in one language it&amp;rsquo;s a natural desire to remove code duplication and reuse as much code as possible.
The approach I&amp;rsquo;m going to explain is based on the fact that React Native loads platform specific Javascript modules based on their extensions.</description>

It is a very nice navigation library and at the moment of writing, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find anything which I would like more.</description>
